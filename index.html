                                                <p>Lady Georgiana Lennox was born to the 4th Duke and Duchess of Richmond on 30th September   1795. Her early years were spent on the Goodwood Estate, before moving to Dublin in 1807 when her father was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It was here that Georgy, as she was known by friends and family, first met Sir Arthur Wellesley, recently returned from his adventures securing Southern India against the French.

                                                <p>Wellington and the Richmond family became very close, and Georgy rode out daily with the 'Great Sir Arthur'. In 1815 the family relocated to Brussels where they witnessed first-hand the events that led to the Battle of Waterloo in June. It was Georgy's mother's ball that took place the night before before fighting broke out, and Georgy's later account of that remarkable evening would become one of the most reliable and interesting recollections of the time.

He said very gravely,"yes,they are true; we are off tomorrow."This terrible news was circulated directly, and while some of the officers hurried away, others remained at the ball,  and actually had not time to change their clothes, but fought in evening costume.</p>

The couple were very happy together and had three children Frances, Dudley and Blanche, Georgy and William visited the Duke of Welington regularly at Apsley House and Stratfield Saye, and Georgy made him Blanche's Godfather.  </p>

                                                                <p>One Day, when we were at Stratfield Saye,the Duke of Wellington was alluding to having learnt Spanish from a Spanish translation of the English Prayer book, Which was given to him when he was going to take command (1808- 9 ) in Spain, by Lady Elinor Butler, the Duke, then Sir Arthur Wellesley, having visited her and Miss Ponsonby at their cottage at Llangollen,as he went through Wales from Ireland. On my asking him what had become of the prayer Book, "Oh,it's somewhere in the library here," was the answer. Whereupon I searched untill I found it, with no name, or anything to tell it's history.

"Londres Impresso por G.Bower a costa de Fran. Coggan en Inner Temple Lane, 1707" from the fact that no bookseller's name is appended to the second edition, Dr Bliss infers that it was not printed in England, but possibly for dispersion among the british merchants resident in Spain. The translator Dr Bliss avers to have been a native of seville, but naturalised in England, and admitted into Holy orders, The late Dean Stanley thought that the basis of the translation might have been made in the time of James 1, for the courtship of Prince charles: first because the titlepage mentions that it contains the alterations necessary to accomadate it to the reign of George 1 , and secondly because the Uniformity act of 1662 is omitted: whereas that of 1558 is printed, as well as the proclamation, never published in modern prayer books, of James 1, but from page XXV11 the Prayer book is taken from that of 1662, with the alterations in the fifth reigns of William 111, and Anne. It is an octavo, and has an engraving of George 1 , as frontispiece, and the date is 1715. Edition Segunda, Corregida y Augmentada; Londres, impresso por William Bowyer, Impessor de Libros.

                                <h1>The Wellington letters</h1>
                                <p>
                                        
                                        
                                        This large collection of letters consisting of 140 in total are written to Georgiana Lennox   and after her marriage in 1824  to Lady de Ros.
                                        
                                        The earliest date is 28th June 1815 and the last is 25 th march 1850. Georgiana lived to the great age of 96 and obviously cherished the memories that these letters gave to her, I don’t think she ever let them out of her possession and her Daughter Blanche did not transcribe the letters until after her death.
                                        
                                        Georgy from a young age was immensely fond of the Duke and although the content of the letters seem very familiar for this period, there relationship was probably like that of a Father and Daughter. Sadly there are none of Georgy’s letters to the Duke that are known to exist, he was known to suggest destroying all personal correspondence, which he seems to have done, Clearly many of the Duke’s lady friends could not bring themselves to do this,
                                        
                                        There are large time spans in some of the letters which is perhaps because some were destroyed or they lived close to each other and the need to correspond was less.
                                        
                                        Strangely none of Georgy’s diaries are known to exist either, however Blanche did copy some of the entries and on hearing of the Duke’s death Georgy wrote: From childhood I loved and venerated him and invariably received the most un-remitting kindness from him and so many years of unclouded friendship cannot be given up without much suffering.
                                        
                                        Georgy’s husband William Fitzgerald de Ros was burdened with the immense responsibility of organising large parts of the funeral procession of the Duke.
                                        
                                        The content of the letters are mostly of a social nature and they discuss many of the activities and tricks  which The Duke and Georgy seemed to enjoy getting up to and they certainly show a different side to the man Known as The Iron Duke.

Between ourselves entirely we have been playing the finest trick ever yet performed: and it is unfortunate that so capital an actress as you should be absent on the occasion. We really quite surpassed ourselves and in the best possible way, the way which is my favourite one viz founding our scheme on a fiction invented and circulated by the person on whom the trick was played.

                                        The Duke also seems to have taken a very keen interest in Georgy’s suitors and referred to them as the enemy.

He was very anxious to show me the boar, and I was equally anxious not to see it and Sir George Murray helped me to avoid the unpleasent sight. The Boars Bristles were given to me, and were mounted for me by Lord Arthur Hill A.D.C. to the Duke, with an Inscription.

                                        The second piece has been woven into the top of a small cedar toothpick  box which has a small mirror. Inside is a note in Georgy's  hand  "Hair of Arthur The 1st Great Duke of Wellington.
                                        
                                        
                                        The third piece was given to Georgy by Kendall , The Duke's  man servant ,Who after his passing immediately wrote two letters to Georgy informing her of the event, one to her london home and one to Strangford in case she was there. When they met in person shortly afterwards Kendall gave her an envelope with a small lock of the Duke's hair he is also supposed to have sent a piece to Queen Victoria.</p>

                                                Stick pins were worn by 19th century gentlemen for fixing through their ties or cravats to keep everything neat and tidy. How this came to the collection is not clear at present, It may have been the Duke's and given to Georgiana or Georgiana maybe had it made after the Dukes Death, It is possibly a hat pin as these tended to be longer than Stick pins.</p>
