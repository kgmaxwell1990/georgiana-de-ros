Taken from Blanche Arthur  Georgina Swinton's book A sketch of the life of Georgiana Lady de Ros.
                                               
                                                
                                               
                                               One Day, when we were at Stratfield Saye,the Duke of Wellington was alluding to having learnt Spanish from a Spanish translation of the English Prayer book, Which was given to him when he was going to take command (1808- 9 ) in Spain, by Lady Elinor Butler, the Duke, then Sir Arthur Wellesley, having visited her and Miss Ponsonby at their cottage at Llangollen,as he went through Wales from Ireland. On my asking him what had become of the prayer Book, "Oh,it's somewhere in the library here," was the answer. Whereupon I searched untill I found it, with no name, or anything to tell it's history.
                                               
                                               He was very much pleased to see it again. and said he would give it to me, as I had taken such pains to find it, I carried it off at once, Soon afterwards the Duke wrote to ask for it, to show to Dr Bliss, Registrar of the university of Oxford. I sent it, Making a condition that before returning it to me, the Duke would write its history inside-- which he did as follows:-
                                               
                                                
                                               
                                               London June 1837
                                               
                                               "This book was given to Lieutenant- General Sir Arthur Wellesley, before he went to command the armies in the Peninsular in 1808, by Lady elinor Butler and Miss Ponsonby, better known as the ladies of Llangollen.
                                               
                                               He had it in his possession and with him during the whole of the war: and learnt from the perusal thereof what he knows of the Spanish Language.
                                               
                                               Lady Elinor Butler was a lineal descendant from the Duke of Ormand, who had resided in Spain and to whom probably the book had belonged. The Duke of Wellington gave it to Lady Georgiana de Ros,"
                                               
                                                
                                               
                                               Independently of its great historical interest, as having belonged to the Duke, the prayer book is a literary curiosity-- there being no other copy extant.
                                               
                                               Dr Bliss mentions in a letter to the Duke, In my possession, that there is  record of a first edition of the prayer book, which is in Christ Church Library, and which appeared in 1707. "Londres Impresso por G.Bower a costa de Fran. Coggan en Inner Temple Lane, 1707" from the fact that no bookseller's name is appended to the second edition, Dr Bliss infers that it was not printed in England, but possibly for dispersion among the british merchants resident in Spain. The translator Dr Bliss avers to have been a native of seville, but naturalised in England, and admitted into Holy orders, The late Dean Stanley thought that the basis of the translation might have been made in the time of James 1, for the courtship of Prince charles: first because the titlepage mentions that it contains the alterations necessary to accomadate it to the reign of George 1 , and secondly because the Uniformity act of 1662 is omitted: whereas that of 1558 is printed, as well as the proclamation, never published in modern prayer books, of James 1, but from page XXV11 the Prayer book is taken from that of 1662, with the alterations in the fifth reigns of William 111, and Anne. It is an octavo, and has an engraving of George 1 , as frontispiece, and the date is 1715. Edition Segunda, Corregida y Augmentada; Londres, impresso por William Bowyer, Impessor de Libros.</p>

                                               From the Dukes correspondence to Georgy it seems she sewed at least two waistcoats one around May  1836 and another in November 1837.

                                        <p>
                                                
                                               
                                               This large collection of letters consisting of 140 in total are written to Georgiana Lennox   and after her marriage in 1824  to Lady de Ros.
                                               
                                               The earliest date is 28th June 1815 and the last is 25 th march 1850. Georgiana lived to the great age of 96 and obviously cherished the memories that these letters gave to her, I don’t think she ever let them out of her possession and her Daughter Blanche did not transcribe the letters until after her death.
                                               
                                               Georgy from a young age was immensely fond of the Duke and although the content of the letters seem very familiar for this period, there relationship was probably like that of a Father and Daughter. Sadly there are none of Georgy’s letters to the Duke that are known to exist, he was known to suggest destroying all personal correspondence, which he seems to have done, Clearly many of the Duke’s lady friends could not bring themselves to do this,
                                               
                                               There are large time spans in some of the letters which is perhaps because some were destroyed or they lived close to each other and the need to correspond was less.
                                               
                                               Strangely none of Georgy’s diaries are known to exist either, however Blanche did copy some of the entries and on hearing of the Duke’s death Georgy wrote: From childhood I loved and venerated him and invariably received the most un-remitting kindness from him and so many years of unclouded friendship cannot be given up without much suffering.
                                               
                                               Georgy’s husband William Fitzgerald de Ros was burdened with the immense responsibility of organising large parts of the funeral procession of the Duke.
                                               
                                               The content of the letters are mostly of a social nature and they discuss many of the activities and tricks  which The Duke and Georgy seemed to enjoy getting up to and they certainly show a different side to the man Known as The Iron Duke.

We really quite surpassed ourselves and in the best possible way, the way which is my favourite one viz founding our scheme on a fiction invented and circulated by the person on whom the trick was played. We are not yet found out which is fortunate. As you say “it would be a pity if you or I were ever discovered as we are so very innocent”]
                                               
                                               The Duke also seems to have taken a very keen interest in Georgy’s suitors and referred to them as the enemy.
